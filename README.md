# Calculator
V1.0
Welcome to my first project! Started on Oct 7th, 2025. Finished on Oct 17th, 2025.
Doing my first project was challenging, especially with the fact that I had to learn three programming languages from zero (HTML, CSS & JavaScript).
My project consists of a Web-developed basic calculator, able to sum, subtract, multiply, divide, and do percentage operations. All of them are in both integer and float data types.
It has a minimalist style using just corner-styled buttons and display divs, but I think it still looks nice.
Although the process was hard, it was enjoyable to learn new things and use them in such a project. This is a great step to be more familiar with the Computer Science experience!
It is free from almost any bug or weird operation, but if any new bug comes up, I wouldn't be surprised.

V1.1
Added positive/negative number button to convert numbers into negative or positive, so it is possible to do operations with negative numbers as well

V1.2
Fixed floating numbers displaying incorrect answers due to binary operations
